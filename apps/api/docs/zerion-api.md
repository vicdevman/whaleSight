It has limits: one subscription & maximum 5 wallets per subscription. You may use callback URL from webhook.site to start from. If want use your custom - contact us at api@zerion.io, and we will whitelist your URL.  If you want to use this endpoint in your production environment, you should contact us and provide the following details: - Your email associated with the API key - The URL that you prefer using as the callback (or host).  After we've whitelisted your callback URL (or host), you may start using this endpoint.    ### Note - **Subscription Validity**: Every subscription is valid for unlimited amount of time for production key, and one week for `dev` keys. - **Transaction Prices**: Prices are not attached to webhook notifications and will always be `null`. Prices are added to transactions in the backend after some time. To get prices, query the transactions endpoint by hash. - **Delivery Guarantees**: Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If delivery fails three times, no further attempts will be made. - **Order of Dispatch**: The order of webhook dispatch is not guaranteed and may not correspond to the order of transactions occurring on the blockchain.  ### Callback Format and Signature Verification Approved clients will receive notifications via POST requests to their provided URL. These notifications will include a signed notification object in the body (specified below in the `Callback` section) and a signature in the headers.  Clients should verify the signature provided in the headers of the webhook request to ensure the authenticity of the data. The following headers will be included: - `X-Signature`: The signature of the request. - `X-Timestamp`: The timestamp of the request. - `X-Certificate-URL`: The URL to download the public certificate used to verify the signature.  **To verify the signature:** 1. Concatenate the `X-Timestamp` header value, the request body, and a newline character: `$timestamp + "\n" + $request.body + "\n"` 2. Use the public certificate downloaded from the `X-Certificate-URL` header to verify the signature in the `X-Signature` header.  Example code in go for message verification:  ```go package signature  import (   "crypto"   "crypto/rsa"   "crypto/sha256"   "crypto/x509"   "encoding/base64"   "encoding/pem"   "errors"   "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"   "testing" )  // FetchCertificate fetches the certificate from the given URL func FetchCertificate() (*x509.Certificate, error) {   certBytes := certificate()   block, _ := pem.Decode(certBytes)   if block == nil || block.Type != "CERTIFICATE" {     return nil, errors.New("failed to decode PEM block containing the certificate")   }    return x509.ParseCertificate(block.Bytes) }  func certificate() []byte {   return []byte(`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDMTCCAhmgAwIBAgIUDd3dFMswamyJ5A1bqF0nzS8v2wgwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL BQAwQTELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxFDASBgNVBAoMC1plcmlvbiBJbmMuMRwwGgYJKoZI hvcNAQkBFg1hcGlAemVyaW9uLmlvMB4XDTI0MDYyNzE1MzUzM1oXDTI1MDYyNzE1 MzUzM1owQTELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxFDASBgNVBAoMC1plcmlvbiBJbmMuMRwwGgYJ KoZIhvcNAQkBFg1hcGlAemVyaW9uLmlvMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8A MIIBCgKCAQEAwcPVCPLDhS9dLA8s5J6GJ3t0+jWuUCFwI+q6c03xZnhCaz45FepN MTiApbvPw1Zm8F8JQB4BRp/F5anokNcDSl/qmNtj3M/z/FrsVvGnSH2FOkZu9TLU LTW5i8Q0LAYrpgiBHrTa2qrRXd2DiMrEs3QZVoylFYc9QIGet3SULPrlSsYEKxfB iBZDoFw619NnV6/kBO8FS34Lc+WH5SNNHNnItRrxMv4DMAFyFajSn1IwV6LSWSNK aPJHCzP/Omu95550HQKcXaJYNE/d99NrcLaFI2fCuEVd00nApFo5knKs0FiXpGca l3cLOQG5SCOzUOjQb6X5CynEV+0QiyYxDwIDAQABoyEwHzAdBgNVHQ4EFgQUVL4m u0PcI4nJGUS8syLi5DNL44YwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQADggEBAKaA1oqW0D6KxvIp IZxWf02XK/YFYwxKV55Vas0VWlzNemE2IjlIj0tknZt0EiM9um2FC27U9n3u0ApS UDrk96dQ+/RY3T3fiuXysa3ZL05OpreRk0aPuFU9rB4iLTgFiv1G/X5XXJ8O7OQb 48u0vQnYXjT/nt72TMUoakjZ68QsP64FkG8mcK62Tg+FVWB9YWTFc0wOjsOt9RzJ muKCQ7qx7L1GhkxKX4ZhrYItsH1DzXjeP5aniZgLBSPbxt01tUrSjOGN5CLOpdG8 iOnAFP+Nz8S0h2C7hppOHgC+uxY285UrzAZQoMbCREMV+0Mq/aqdF1B6qoKGNGqL kFbUhvo= -----END CERTIFICATE----- `) }  func VerifySignature(cert *x509.Certificate, message, signature string) error {   pubKey := cert.PublicKey.(*rsa.PublicKey)    hashed := sha256.Sum256([]byte(message))   sigBytes, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(signature)   if err != nil {     return err   }    return rsa.VerifyPKCS1v15(pubKey, crypto.SHA256, hashed[:], sigBytes) }  func TestVerifySignature(t *testing.T) {   // Example usage   x509Cert, err := FetchCertificate()   assert.NoError(t, err)    xTimestamp := "2024-07-31T00:17:36Z"   xSignature := "t65gdR8z3NGh/OQRPzGMFmw36JhDNvOe6LxL6K2hCd3SdYQoTGr76dAy1CpsX2G8XVOIYUIctUQvgICQvtDctVjkRZmXuQDvXHOmiJE0ZknORgjVLFoo5JRYKvwt3EPp6SMN7RtedIX17rH1s2Vp3GRQWSjzN7C/cNgInhCQOP0UDjYlaeNT/yW4B2Qt4uY01yK0YhvQJaFHN+NNr7DZAt4FJuDppItqjaYbHTaFNqLlpI1IX7YvQWVhEYTJY6M4T9IdcGYPJKDljckjvmj9mDHZeh/Y6w8eXjLziMSFvlhJeSn1kBIR3nS7lTcwFNv1CPxD3MM7VB++te3mBbFubg=="   messageBody := `{"data":{"attributes":{"timestamp":"2024-07-31T00:17:36.661896043Z"},"id":"15daee90-5028-4b4c-bd49-b4d43fa1a89e","type":"callback"},"included":[{"attributes":{"application_metadata":{"contract_address":"0x8286d601a0ed6cf75e067e0614f73a5b9f024151","method":{"id":"0x7859bb8d","name":""}},"approvals":[],"fee":{"fungible_info":{"flags":{"verified":true},"icon":{"url":"https://cdn.zerion.io/eth.png"},"implementations":[{"address":"","chain_id":"redstone","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"polygon-zkevm","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"optimism","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"zksync-era","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"mode","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"base","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"ethereum","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"aurora","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"scroll","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"rari","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"astar-zkevm","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"arbitrum","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"zora","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"blast","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"linea","decimals":18},{"address":"","chain_id":"manta-pacific","decimals":18}],"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH"},"price":null,"quantity":{"decimals":18,"float":0.0000016785001958,"int":"1678500195825","numeric":"0.000001678500195825"},"value":null},"flags":{"is_trash":false},"hash":"0xbbcfb0ac5e466ded168794a162da334634fee3f95adfdb55392999f91b4c6d41","mined_at":"2024-07-31T00:17:35Z","mined_at_block":7490818,"nonce":250,"operation_type":"execute","sent_from":"0xfc0f1b3fb88c5ab19e77a6f7d4d637272e71e684","sent_to":"0x8286d601a0ed6cf75e067e0614f73a5b9f024151","status":"confirmed","transfers":[]},"id":"a65b2541c58a5908a7333480f0ac6792","relationships":{"chain":{"id":"linea","type":"chains"},"dapp":{"id":"","type":"dapps"}},"type":"transactions"}]}`    message := xTimestamp + "\n" + messageBody + "\n"    err = VerifySignature(x509Cert, message, xSignature)   assert.NoError(t, err) } ```

- [Get fungibles available for bridge.](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/swapfungibles.md): The endpoint provides a list of fungibles available for bridge exchange. This endpoint is specifically designed for situations where the input and output chains are different.
- [Get available swap offers](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/swapoffers.md): The endpoint offers a comprehensive overview of relevant trades and bridge exchanges. A bridge exchange refers to the transfer of cryptocurrencies between different blockchain networks, while a trade pertains to an exchange of cryptocurrencies within the same network. In an effort to secure the optimal exchange rate for our users, our system sends requests to multiple exchange providers. Zerion only charges a commission fee of 0.5% on L2 and alternative L1 trades, which can be waived by obtaining our Genesis NFT. Our platform has the advantage of being an aggregator of various exchanges, ensuring that users will always get the best exchange rates available. Please note that due to the nature of the multiple requests and calculations involved, it is normal for this endpoint to have a relatively long timeout. You can expect a response time of around 5-10 seconds.
- [Get wallet's balance chart](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/getwalletchart.md): This endpoint returns a portfolio balance chart for a wallet. This is over a specified time period, based on the provided start and end timestamps.  Results can be filtered by blockchain and asset type, offering flexible and detailed visualizations of wallet performance, similar to what you see in the Zerion interface.   Note: We do not support historical protocol positions data.
- [Get wallet's NFT portfolio](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/getwalletnftportfolio.md): This endpoint returns the NFT portfolio overview of a web3 wallet.  This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.  If the address was not added before it is possible that this endpoint will return `202` status. It means that portfolio for the wallet is not prepared yet, but will be available soon. In that case the client have to request this endpoint periodically, while `200` status wasn't returned.  > NOTE: Don't forget to stop retries after some reasonable period of time. If the `200` status is not returned within 2 minutes it most probably means that some unexpected error occurred and the client should stop the polling.
- [Get wallet's PnL](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/getwalletpnl.md): This endpoint returns the Profit and Loss (PnL) details of a web3 wallet. This includes Unrealized PnL, Realized PnL, Net Invested amounts and filters for asset categories like Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs).  It uses the FIFO (First In, First Out) standard for calculations, providing accurate insights into wallet performance.  Ideal for tracking and analyzing financial outcomes of wallet activity.

If the `200` status is not returned within 2 minutes it most probably means that some unexpected error occurred and the client should stop the polling.  > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.
- [wallets ](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/wallets.md)
- [Get a list of NFT collections held by a wallet](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/listwalletnftcollections.md): This endpoint returns a list of the NFT collections held by a specific wallet.  This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.  If the wallet address has not been previously added, this endpoint may return a `202` status code. This indicates that the wallet's collections are not yet available, but will be in the near future. In this case, the client should periodically request this endpoint until a `200` status code is returned.  > NOTE: It is important to stop retrying after a reasonable period of time. If a `200` status code is not returned within 2 minutes, it is likely that an unexpected error has occurred, and the client should stop polling.  > NOTE: This endpoint provides support for filters, sorting. Ensure that the length of the request URL falls within a safe range for your platform. Typically, a length of 2000 characters is a safe limit for most combinations of client and server software.  > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.
- [Get a list of a wallet's NFT positions](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/listwalletnftpositions.md): This endpoint returns a list of the NFT positions held by a specific wallet.  This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.  If the wallet address has not been previously added, this endpoint may return a `202` status code. This indicates that the wallet's positions are not yet available, but will be in the near future. In this case, the client should periodically request this endpoint until a `200` status code is returned.  > NOTE: It is important to stop retrying after a reasonable period of time. If a `200` status code is not returned within 2 minutes, it is likely that an unexpected error has occurred and the client should stop polling.  > NOTE: This endpoint provides support for filters, sorting, and pagination parameters. Ensure that the length of the request URL falls within a safe range for your platform. Typically, a length of 2000 characters is a safe limit for most combinations of client and server software.  > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.
- [Get list of wallet's fungible positions](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/listwalletpositions.md): This endpoint returns a list of wallet positions.  This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.  **Understanding Liquidity Pool Positions:**  Liquidity pools (Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, etc.) return **multiple positions** - one for each token in the pool. Positions belonging to the same pool share the same `group_id` value in attributes.  For example, a Uniswap V2 USDC/WETH pool returns two positions: - Position 1: WETH token, `group_id="820ee2f1ca8ccb716f6beb5e450908a028be890ec44aba87c739b416ef41e197"`, `fungible_info.symbol="WETH"` - Position 2: USDC token, `group_id="820ee2f1ca8ccb716f6beb5e450908a028be890ec44aba87c739b416ef41e197"`, `fungible_info.symbol="USDC"`  To display all tokens in a liquidity pool together, group positions by their `group_id` attribute.  **Temporary limitations for Solana addresses:** - Doesn't support protocol positions  > NOTE: Don't forget to stop retries after some reasonable period of time. If the `200` status is not returned within 2 minutes it most probably means that some unexpected error occurred and the client should stop the polling.  > NOTE: This endpoint supports a lot of filters, sorting and pagination parameters. Make sure that a request URL length is in a safe range for your platform. Usually, 2000 characters are the safe limit in virtually any combination of client and server software.  > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.
- [Get list of wallet's transactions](https://developers.zerion.io/reference/listwallettransactions.md): This endpoint returns a list of transactions associated with the wallet.  This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.  **Temporary limitations for Solana addresses:** - Doesn't support NFT transactions  > NOTE: This endpoint supports a lot of filters, sorting, and pagination parameters.
